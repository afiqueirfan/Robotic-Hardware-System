  ****Types of Drones****
  
  **Multi-Rotor Drones**  
  ~ The most popular type of drone for getting an “eye in the sky” is the multi-rotor drone. This is the popular choice for     aerial photography, filmmaking and surveillance. It is used by professionals and hobbyists alike because of its small       size and ready to fly out of the box capabilities
  
  - It provides better control of the aircraft during the flight.
  
  - Due to its increased manoeuvrability, it can move up and down on the same vertical line, back to front, side to side       and rotate in its own axis.
  
  - It has the ability to fly much more closely to structures and buildings.
  
  - The ability to take multiple payloads per flight increases its operational efficiency and reduces the time taken for        inspections.

  **Fixed-Wing Drones**
  
  ~ Fixed wing UAVs typically have one or two props, and rely on their wings to provide lift. These drones take off, land,      and fly much like conventional planes with smooth, bird-like flight characteristics
  
  - Fixed-wing drones cover longer distances, map much larger areas, and loiter for long times monitoring their point of       interest. The average flight time is a couple of hours. But with a greater energy density of fuel (gas engine powered),     many fixed-wing UAVs can stay aloft for 16 hours or more.
  
  - This drone type can fly at a high altitude, carry more weight and are more forgiving in the air than other drone types.

  **Single-Rotor Drones**
  
  ~ Single rotor drones are used for surveyors and construction professionals who want to lift heavier payloads of up to       40kgs because the single rotor is more efficient in the lift and uses less battery or fuel life as it flies. They can       also fly faster than multi-rotors
  - A single-rotor helicopter has the benefit of much greater efficiency over a multi-rotor, which increases if the drone       is gas-powered for even longer endurance.
  - A single-rotor helicopter allows for very long blades, which are more like a spinning wing than a propeller, giving         great efficiency.
  - If you need to hover with a heavy payload (e.g. an aerial LIDAR laser scanner) or have a mixture of hovering with long     endurance or fast forward flight, then a single-rotor helicopter is really your best bet.
  - They are built to be strong and durable

  **Fixed-Wing Hybrid VTOL**
  
  ~ VTOL fixed-wing drones can be used to provide real-time, accurate 3D comparable data, which is essential to effective       infrastructure planning and helps detect deteriorating conditions and underdeveloped areas of infrastructure
  
  - The autopilot can do all the hard work of keeping the drone stable, leaving the human pilot the easier task of guiding     it around the sky.
  - Hybrid VTOL drones offer you the best of both worlds – fixed-wing & rotor-based designs.
  - They are perfect at either hovering or forward flight.
