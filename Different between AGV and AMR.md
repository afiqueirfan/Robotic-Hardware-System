  **AMR**
-AMR stands for Autonomous Mobile Robot. It is a vehicle that uses on-boarded sensors and processors to move materials autonomously without any need of physical guides or any other markers
- AMR does not requires pre mapping in order for it to move since it will map the route as it goes through slam navigation.

  **AGV**
-AGV stands for Automated Guided Vehicle. It is a robot which is portable and follows marking lines or wires on the floor, use radio waves, vision cameras, magnets, or lasers for navigation.
- It requires some sort of marking before it can move to the deginated location usually after slam navigation has been done.

 **SLAM NAVIGATION**
 - Slam is a process where an AMR map the location with LIDAR to determine the route for an AGV to use.
 
 - The advantages of SLAM is that it can register the mapping of the location precisely with just LIDAR. 
 - The disadvantage by using only LIDAR is that when some obstacles is detected after the slamming has been done it unable to identified whta the obstacles is.
 - To improve the system by equipping cameras so that the obstacles can be identified.
